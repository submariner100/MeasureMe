# MeasureMe
Small basic application exploring ARKit to measure distances A to B
Lessons learnt - This was an exercise in writing a small basic program using ARKit to measure distances. I used SceneKit to create 
an vitual object ie. a box and the user can click between two points where then the distance is measured.
